\description{
This dataset contains annotated tokens from the Peace Book volumes created by
the Historical Section of the British Foreign Office and published in 1920.
This dataset contains only those tokens that were included in the Bing
sentiment dictionary that is part of the `textdata` package.
The POS and entity tagging was preserved only for the tokens with sentiment
value, tokens without sentiment values were removed. This means that
this dataset cannot be used for analysing NER or POS annotations, because
not all annotated tokens in the corpus are included in this dataset.
The POS and NER annotation were done by using the package `spacyr`.
